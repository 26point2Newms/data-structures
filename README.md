# data-structures
Various data structures implemented in Python 3 with unit tests.

These implementations are mostly for instructional and interview preparation purposes in case you are asking yourself, "why the heck would you implement a hash table in python when you have a dictionary built into the langage?". However, some of these classes such as the LinkedList, could be useful in production code.
